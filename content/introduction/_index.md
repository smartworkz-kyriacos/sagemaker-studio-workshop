# SageMaker Studio

In this workshop, you will explore the development cycle of the machine learning model on AWS. A sample project fully developed in a SageMaker notebook instance is included. The notebooks are divided into different stages:

* Ingestion
* Exploratory analysis
* ETL to prepare training data
* Training the model with Hyperparameter Optimization
* Putting "new data" through a preprocessing pipeline to get it ready for prediction
* Batch predictions for new data
* Real-time predictions for new data
