We know that data science projects involve many complex, multidisciplinary, and iterative steps. We need access to a machine-learning development environment that supports the model prototyping stage and equally provides a smooth transition to prepare our model for production. We will likely want to experiment with various machine learning frameworks and algorithms and develop custom model training and inference code.

Other times, we might want to just use a readily available, pre-trained model to solve a simple task. Or we might want to leverage AutoML techniques to create a first base‐ line for our project. AWS provides a broad set of services and features for each scenario. Figure 1-3 shows the entire Amazon AI and machine learning stack, including AI services and Amazon SageMaker Autopilot for AutoML.

For many common use cases, such as personalized product recommendations, content moderation, or demand forecasting, we can also use Amazon’s managed AI services with the option to fine-tune our custom datasets. We can integrate these “1-click” AI services into our applications via simple API calls without much (some‐ times no) machine learning experience needed.

The fully managed AWS AI services are the fastest and easiest way to add intelligence to our applications using simple API calls. The AI services offer pre-trained or automatically trained machine learning models for image and video analysis, advanced text and document analysis, personalized recommendations, or demand forecasting.

AI services include Amazon Comprehend for natural language processing, Amazon Rekognition for computer vision, Amazon Personalize for generating product recommendations, Amazon Forecast for demand forecasting, and Amazon CodeGuru for automated source code reviews.
