# Getting Started
To start the workshop, let's create a Jupyter Notebook in Sagemaker and clone the repos to it in order to continue with the first part:

* Exploratory analysis
* ETL to prepare training data
* Training the model with Hyperparameter Optimization
* Putting “new data” through a preprocessing pipeline to get it ready for prediction
* Batch predictions for new data
