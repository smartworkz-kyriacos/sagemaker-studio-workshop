**Using Warm Start**

Warm start configuration allows you to create a new tuning job with the learning gathered in a parent tuning job by specifying up to 5 parent tuning jobs. If a warm start configuration is specified, Automatic Model Tuning will load the previous \[hyperparameter set, objective metrics values\] to warm start the new tuning job. This means you can continue optimizing your model from the point you finished your previous tuning job experiment.
