**Tuning**

Amazon SageMaker automatic model tuning, also called hyperparameter tuning (HPT), finds the best-performing model against a defined objective metric by running many training jobs on the dataset using the algorithm and ranges of hyperparameters that you specify. SageMaker HPT supports both random search and bayesian optimization as tuning strategies.
