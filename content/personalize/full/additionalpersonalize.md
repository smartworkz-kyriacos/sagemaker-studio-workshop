If you have built the additional two Personalize models, for Item-to-Item Similarities and Personal Rankings, then you'll need to create the associated campaigns for these solutions, as it is the campaigns that we will add to the application. If those solutions have been built then continue with these steps, but if not you can always come back to these steps later before adding them to the application.

In the AWS Console, go to the Amazon Personalize service console, click on ***Dataset*** groups link on the left-hand menu, and select the ***personalize-recs-dataset-group*** link, then click into the ***Campaigns*** menu item on the left. Select ***Create Campaign***

First, we want to build the campaign for the Similar Items model - enter a name for the campaign, such as ***similar-items-campaign***, select via the drop-down that solution that you previously built in the console, ***similar-items-solution***, and ensure that minimum TPS is set to ***1***. Hit ***Create Campaign***

Now build the campaign for the Personal Rankings model - follow the same steps as before, but this time use ***rankings-campaign*** for the campaign name and select the ***rankings-solution*** model in the drop-down control.
