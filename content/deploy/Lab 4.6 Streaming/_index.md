# Lab 4.6 Streaming

In this module, we move from our customer reviews training dataset into a real-world scenario. We will focus on analyzing a continuous stream of product review messages that we collect from all available online channels. Customer-product feedback appears everywhere, including social media channels, partner websites, and customer support systems. We need to capture this valuable customer sentiment about our products as quickly as possible to spot trends and react fast.

With streaming analytics and machine learning, we are able to analyze continuous data streams such as application logs, social media feeds, e-commerce transactions, customer support tickets, and product reviews. For example, we may want to detect quality issues by analyzing real-time product reviews.
