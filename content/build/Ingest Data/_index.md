# 2.1 Ingest Data

In this part, we will show how to ingest data into the cloud. For that purpose, we will look at a typical scenario in which an application writes files into an Amazon S3 data lake, which in turn needs to be accessed by the ML engineering/data science team as well as the business intelligence/data analyst team, as shown in Figure 2-1.
