# 2.2 Explore Data

In this chapter, we will use the SageMaker Studio integrated development environment (IDE) as our main workspace for data analysis and the model development life cycle. SageMaker Studio provides fully managed Jupyter Notebook servers. With just a couple of clicks, we can provision the SageMaker Studio IDE and start using Jupyter notebooks to run ad hoc data analysis and launch Apache Spark-based data-quality jobs.

We will use SageMaker Studio throughout the rest of the book to launch data processing and feature engineering jobs in Chapter 6, train models in Chapter 7, optimize models in Chapter 8, deploy models in Chapter 9, build pipelines in Chapter 10, develop streaming applications in Chapter 11, and secure our data science projects in Chapter 12.
