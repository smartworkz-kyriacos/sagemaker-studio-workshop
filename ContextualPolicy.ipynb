    "### The Contextual Bandits\n",
    "Here we define our contextual bandits. In this example, we are using three four-armed bandit. What this means is that each bandit has four arms that can be pulled. Each bandit has different success probabilities for each arm, and as such requires different actions to obtain the best result. The pullBandit function generates a random number from a normal distribution with a mean of 0. The lower the bandit number, the more likely a positive reward will be returned. We want our agent to learn to always choose the bandit-arm that will most often give a positive reward, depending on the Bandit presented."

    "The code below established our simple neural agent. It takes as input the current state, and returns an action. This allows the agent to take actions which are conditioned on the state of the environment, a critical step toward being able to solve full RL problems. The agent uses a single set of weights, within which each value is an estimate of the value of the return from choosing a particular arm given a bandit. We use a policy gradient method to update the agent by moving the value for the selected action toward the recieved reward."
